                the first games developed in the early history of video games. American physicist William Higinbotham designed the game in 1958 
                for display at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's annual public exhibition after learning that the government research institution's Donner 
                Model 30 analog computer could simulate trajectories with wind resistance.

                    manufactured by Atari and originally released on 29 November 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video games; It was created by Allan Alcorn as 
                    a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality 
                    of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game. Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox 
                    Odyssey, the first home video game console. In response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement.

                    the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). This generation marked the end of the video game crash of 1983, and a 
                    shift in the dominance of home video game manufacturers from the United States to Japan.

            </div>
            <div class = "pright">
                <p>In addition to the transition to optical media, the industry as a whole had a major shift toward real-time 3D computer graphics across games during the 1990s. There had been a number of arcade games that used simple wireframe vector graphics to simulate 3D, such as Battlezone, Tempest, and Star Wars. A unique challenge in 3D computer graphics is that real-time rendering typically requires floating-point calculations, which until the 1990s, most video game hardware was not well-suited for. Instead, many games simulated 3D effects such as by using parallax rendering of different background layers, scaling of sprites as they moved towards or away from the player's view, or other rendering methods such as the SNES's Mode 7. These tricks to simulate 3D-rendeder graphics through 2D systems are generally referred to as 2.5D graphics. 
                    <br><br>
                    True real-time 3D rendering using polygons were soon popularized by Yu Suzuki's Sega AM2 games Virtua Racing (1992) and Virtua Fighter (1993), both running on the Sega Model 1 arcade system board; some of the Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) staff involved in the creation of the original PlayStation video game console credit Virtua Fighter as inspiration for the PlayStation's 3D graphics hardware.
