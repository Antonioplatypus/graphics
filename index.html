                <p>Tennis for Two (also known as Computer Tennis) is a sports video game that simulates a game of tennis, and was one of
                the first games developed in the early history of video games. American physicist William Higinbotham designed the game in 1958 
                for display at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's annual public exhibition after learning that the government research institution's Donner 
                Model 30 analog computer could simulate trajectories with wind resistance.

                    manufactured by Atari and originally released on 29 November 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video games; It was created by Allan Alcorn as 
                    a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality 
                    of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game. Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox 
                    Odyssey, the first home video game console. In response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement.

                    overseas distribution. Commonly considered as one of the most influential video games of all time, Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter 
                    and set the template for the genre.

                <p>In the history of video games, the third generation of video game consoles, commonly referred to as the 8-bit era, 
                    began on July 15, 1983, with the Japanese release of two systems: Nintendo's Family Computer (commonly abbreviated 
                    to Famicom) and Sega's SG-1000.When the Famicom was not released outside of Japan, it was remodeled and marketed as 
                    the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). This generation marked the end of the video game crash of 1983, and a 
                    shift in the dominance of home video game manufacturers from the United States to Japan.
