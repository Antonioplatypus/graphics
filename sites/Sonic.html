    <p class = "textMain"> Sonic the Hedgehog was very well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay. It is widely considered one of the 
    greatest video games of all time and became one of the best-selling video games of all time with approximately 24 million copies sold worldwide. It established 
    the Genesis as a key player in the 16-bit era and allowed it to compete with the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It has been ported to multiple systems 
    and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into other media. It was followed by Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in 1992.  </p>

                    <p>Development began in 1990 when Sega ordered its developers to create a game featuring a mascot for the company. The developers chose a blue 
                        hedgehog designed by Naoto Oshima after he won an internal character design contest, and named themselves Sonic Team to match their character. It uses a novel 
                        technique that allows Sonic's sprite to roll along curved scenery which was based on a concept by Oshima from 1989. Sonic the Hedgehog, designed for fast 
                        gameplay, was influenced by games by Super Mario series creator Shigeru Miyamoto. The music was composed by Masato Nakamura, bassist of the J-pop band Dreams 
                        Come True.

            The team developed ideas for characters, an engine, and gameplay mechanics. Development emphasized speed, so Sega considered fast creatures such as 
            kangaroos and squirrels and eliminated designs not associated with fast animals. One idea, a rabbit able to grasp objects with prehensile ears, 
            showed promise but was too complex for the Genesis hardware. The team narrowed its search to animals that could roll into a ball, their idea for an 
            attacking move, and considered armadillos and hedgehogs. The hedgehog character, proposed by Naoto Ohshima, prevailed. Ohshima went on vacation to New
            York, taking sketches with him. He went to Central Park and asked locals for their opinions on them, and Sonic was the favorite. A man with a moustache, 
            who eventually became Dr. Robotnik, was in second place.
            <br><br>Ohshima said that "Sonic" was chosen because it represented speed. Sonic was originally teal-colored, then a light shade of blue, but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds
            and to match the Sega logo. According to Ohshima, Sonic's basic design was created by combining Felix the Cat's head with Mickey Mouse's body. His shoes 
            had buckles through the inspiration of Michael Jackson's boots on the album cover for Bad and the red and white color scheme of Santa Claus, whom Ohshima 
            saw as the most "famous character in the world". Sonic's spikes were emphasized to make him sleeker, and he was given the ability to spin while jumping 
            (so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button). The new character was originally named "Mr. Hedgehog", but the eight-member team 
            changed his name to "Sonic" and took the name Sonic Team.
            <br><br>With a satisfying protagonist established, Sega turned to the programmer Yuji Naka, who had impressed them with his work on Phantasy Star and the 
            Genesis port of Ghouls 'n Ghosts. Naka was a fan of Super Mario Bros. but wanted something faster, so the game was made to play quickly, which was where 
            he focused most of his effort. Naka explained that the reason he wanted a fast game was that he had ported Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and wanted to work on its 
            movement but found it slow.
            <br><br>Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by a team of seven: two programmers, two sound engineers, and three designers, although it began with just 
            Ohshima and Naka. People came onto the team as the need for content increased. After being assigned a project with the code name "Defeat Mario", Ohshima 
            and Naka began work, but encountered problems: Ohshima's Rabbit proved hard to program. Catching items and throwing them caused the action's rhythm to 
            break. Naka stated that the rabbit was not suitable for his game engine, and he also wanted the game to be playable with only one button. Hirokazu 
            Yasuhara came onto the team to supervise Ohshima and Naka and develop levels. He became the lead designer due to his greater experience, and found the way 
            to make the game playable with only one button by having Sonic do damage by jumping. The trio came up with the idea of him rolling into a ball. After the 
            hedgehog character was chosen, many characters were redrawn, and the team agreed on the environments' visual complexity, with particular focus on the 
            colors. After this, four people came onto the team to speed development up
            <br><br>Due to the popularity of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic to take over the American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. 
            Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing 
            Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved this by developing an algorithm retained fluidity. All that was left was to optimize of the game speed 
            to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, 
            which caused disagreements. As a result, it was slowed down.
            <br><br>In designing the gameplay, Naka was inspired by Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring the 
            simplicity of Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a 
            single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action-oriented than the Mario series; while playing Super Mario Bros., he had wondered 
            why the levels could not be cleared more quickly.
            <br><br>Naka's relationship with Sega was tenuous during this time, and he received little credit for his work. He left the company shortly after the 
            game's release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few 
            names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code.[18] Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created 
            maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept 
            restarting from scratch. He stated that he found the process "very interesting". Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and 
            that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a 
            challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards.

            <p class="textMain">
            At the 1991 Golden Joystick Awards, Sonic the Hedgehog won Overall Game of the Year. In the 1991 Electronic Gaming Monthly awards, Sonic the Hedgehog won 
            Game of the Year. At the European Computer Trade Show (ECTS) awards, it won the awards for Best Video Game and Going Live Viewers Award. In 1992, Mega 
            ranked Sonic as their third-favorite Genesis game. In 1995, Flux magazine rated the game 4th in its "Top 100 Video Games." In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the
            game 78th on their "Top 100 Games of All Time." In 2016, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted Sonic the Hedgehog to its World Video Game Hall of 
            Fame.
            <br><br>
            Primarily because of its Genesis bundling, Sonic the Hedgehog was a factor in popularising the console in North America, thus solidifying it as a 
            competitor to Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System. During October and December 1991 with the game's success, the Genesis outsold the SNES 
            by two to one; at its January 1992 peak it gained a foothold in the industry and had 65 percent of the market for 16-bit consoles. Although Nintendo 
            eventually overtook Sega, it was the first time since December 1985 that Nintendo did not lead the console market.
            <br><br>
            Sonic's success led to an extensive media franchise, with the first of many sequels, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, released the following year. It has generated 
            dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters, keeping Sonic and Robotnik (later renamed as Eggman) mainstays, and continued beyond 
            Sega's exit from the console industry after the Dreamcast. The series has ventured from platformers to fighting, racing, role-playing, and sports games,
            and also expanded into anime, manga, cartoons, comic books, novels, and toys. Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time,
            with over 140 million copies sold or downloaded worldwide across consoles, PC's, mobile phones and tablets by May 2014.
