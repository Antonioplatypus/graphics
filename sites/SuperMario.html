    <p class = "textMain"> Super Mario Bros. is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time, and is particularly 
    admired for its precise controls. It has been re-released on most Nintendo systems, and is one of the bestselling games of
    all time, with more than 58 million copies sold worldwide. It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving 
    the video game industry after the 1983 crash, and helped popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre. Koji Kondo's soundtrack 
    is one of the earliest and most popular in video games, making music a centerpiece of game design and has since been considered one 
    of the best video game soundtracks of all time as a result. Mario has become prominent in popular culture, and Super Mario Bros.
    began a multimedia franchise including a long-running game series, an animated television series, a Japanese anime feature film,
    a live-action feature film and an animated feature film.</p>

                    <p>The development of Super Mario Bros. is an early example of specialization in the video game industry, 
                    made possible and necessary by the Famicom's arcade-capable hardware. Miyamoto designed the game world and led a 
                    team of seven programmers and artists who turned his ideas into code, sprites, music, and sound effects. Developers 
                    of previous hit games joined the team, importing many special programming techniques, features, and design 
                    refinements such as these: "Donkey Kong's slopes, lifts, conveyor belts, and ladders; Donkey Kong Jr.'s ropes,
                     logs and springs; and Mario Bros.'s enemy attacks, enemy movement, frozen platforms and POW Blocks".

            Miyamoto also wanted to create a game that would be the "final exclamation point" for the ROM cartridge format before the 
            forthcoming Famicom Disk System was released. Super Mario Bros. was made in tandem with The Legend of Zelda, another 
            Famicom game directed and designed by Miyamoto and released in Japan five months later, and the games shared some elements;
             for instance, the fire bars that appear in the Mario castle levels began as objects in Zelda.
            <br><br>The team based the level design around a small Mario, intending to later make his size bigger in the final version,
            but they decided it would be fun to let Mario change his size via a power-up. The early level design was focused on 
            teaching players that mushrooms were distinct from Goombas and would be beneficial to them, so in World 1-1, 
            the first mushroom is difficult to avoid if it is released.The use of mushrooms to change size was influenced by Japanese
             folktales in which people wander into forests and eat magical mushrooms; this also resulted in the game world being named
              the "Mushroom Kingdom". 
            <br><br>Super Mario Bros. was developed for a cartridge with 256 kilobits (32KiB) of program code and data and 64 kilobits
            (8KiB) of sprite and background graphics. Due to this storage limitation, the designers happily considered their 
            aggressive search for space-saving opportunities to be akin to their own fun television game show competition. For instance,
            clouds and bushes in the game's backgrounds use that same sprite recolored, and background tiles are generated via an 
            automatic algorithm. Sound effects were also recycled; the sound when Mario is damaged is the same as when he enters a pipe,
            and Mario jumping on an enemy is the same sound as each stroke when swimming. After completing the game, the 
            development team decided that they should introduce players with a simple, easy-to-defeat enemy rather than beginning the 
            game with Koopa Troopas. By this point, the project had nearly run out of memory, so the designers created the Goombas by
             making a single static image and flipping it back and forth to save space while creating a convincing character animation.
            After the addition of the game's music, around 20 bytes of open cartridge space remained. Miyamoto used this remaining 
            space to add a sprite of a crown into the game, which would appear in the player's life counter as a reward for 
            obtaining at least 10 lives.

            <p class="textMain">
                The success of Super Mario Bros. led to the development of many successors in the Super Mario series of video games,
                which in turn form the core of the greater Mario franchise. Two of these sequels, Super Mario Bros. 2 and Super Mario
                Bros. 3, were direct sequels to the game and were released for the NES, experiencing similar levels of commercial 
                success. A different sequel, also titled Super Mario Bros. 2, was released for the Famicom Disk System in 1986 
                exclusively in Japan and was later released elsewhere under the name Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels. 
                The gameplay concepts and elements established in Super Mario Bros. are prevalent in nearly every Super Mario game. 
                The series consists of over 15 entries; at least one Super Mario game has been released on nearly every Nintendo 
                console to date.
            <br><br>
            The game's success helped to push Mario as a worldwide cultural icon; in 1990, a study taken in North America suggested 
            that more children in the United States were familiar with Mario than they were with Mickey Mouse, another popular media 
            character.The game's musical score composed by Koji Kondo, particularly the game's "overworld" theme, has also become a 
            prevalent aspect of popular culture, with the latter theme being featured in nearly every single Super Mario game.
            Alongside the NES platform, Super Mario Bros. is often credited for having resurrected the video game industry after 
            the market crash of 1983.
            <br><br>
            Because of its status within the video game industry and being an early Nintendo game, mint condition copies of 
            Super Mario Bros. have been considered collectors items. In 2019, the auction of a near-mint, sealed box version of the
            game was sold for just over $100,000, and which is considered to have drawn wider interest in the field of video game 
            collecting. One year later in July 2020, a similar near-mint sealed box copy of the game, 
            from the period when Nintendo was transitioning from sticker-seals to shrinkwrap, was sold for $114,000, at the time the 
            highest price ever for a single video game.
