    <p class = "textMain"> Space Invaders is considered one of the most influential video games ever made, having ushered in the golden age of arcade video games. 
    It was the inspiration for numerous video games and game designers across different genres, and has been ported and re-released in various forms. The 1980 Atari 
    VCS version quadrupled sales of the VCS, thereby becoming the first killer app for video game consoles. More broadly, the pixelated enemy alien has become a pop 
    culture icon, often representing video games as a whole. 
    <br><br>Designer Tomohiro Nishikado drew inspiration from North American target shooting games like Breakout (1976) and Gun Fight (1975), as well as science 
    fiction narratives such as the novel The War of the Worlds (1897), the anime Space Battleship Yamato (1974), and the film Star Wars (1977). 
    To complete development, he had to design custom hardware and development tools. Upon release, Space Invaders was an immediate commercial success; by 1982, 
    it had grossed $3.8 billion ($13 billion in 2022-adjusted terms), with a net profit of $450 million ($1.6 billion in 2022 terms). This made it the 
    best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product at the time, and the highest-grossing video game of all time. </p>

                    <p>Space Invaders was developed by Japanese designer Tomohiro Nishikado, who spent a year designing it and developing the necessary hardware to produce it.
                        The game was a response to Atari's arcade game Breakout (1976). Nishikado wanted to adapt the same sense of achievement and tension from destroying 
                        targets one at a time, combining it with elements of target shooting games. The game uses a similar layout to that of Breakout but with different game 
                        mechanics; rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects, players are given the ability to fire projectiles at moving enemies.

            Nishikado added several interactive elements that he found lacking in earlier video games, such as the ability for enemies to react to the player's 
            movement and fire back, and a game over triggered by the enemies killing the player (either by getting hit or enemies reaching the bottom of the screen) 
            rather than simply a timer running out. He replaced the timer, typical of arcade games at the time, with descending aliens who effectively served a 
            similar function, where the closer they came, the less time the player had left.

            <p class="textMain">
                As one of the earliest shooting games, Space Invaders set precedents and helped pave the way for future games and for the shooting genre. 
                Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay, with the enemies responding to the player-controlled cannon's movement,
                and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. While earlier shooting 
                games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which multiple enemies could fire back at the player, and in contrast 
                to earlier arcade games which often had a timer, Space Invaders introduced the "concept of going round after round." It was also the first game where
                players were given multiple lives, had to repel hordes of enemies, could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers, 
                in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, 
                which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.
            <br><br>
            An urban legend states that Space Invaders' popularity led to a shortage of 100-yen coins in Japan. However, Nishikado himself was skeptical of the story.
            In reality, 100-yen coin production was lower in 1978 and 1979 than in previous or subsequent years. Additionally, arcade operators would have regularly 
            emptied their machines and taken the coins to the bank, thus keeping them in circulation. Reports from those living in Japan at the time indicate 
            "nothing out of the ordinary ... during the height of the Space Invaders invasion".
            <br><br>
            Space Invaders was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in 2016. Space Invaders cabinets have become collector's items, with the cocktail 
            and cabaret versions being the rarest.
