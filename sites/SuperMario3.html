    <p class = "textMain"> Players control brothers Mario or Luigi, who must save Princess Toadstool and the rulers of seven different kingdoms from the antagonist 
    Bowser. As in previous Mario games, they defeat enemies by stomping on them or using items that bestow magical powers; they also have new abilities, including 
    flight and sliding down slopes. Super Mario Bros. 3 introduced many elements that became Super Mario staples, such as Bowser's children (the Koopalings) and a 
    world map to transition between levels. 
    <br><br>
    Super Mario Bros. 3 was praised by critics for its challenging gameplay and is regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time. It is the 
    third-best-selling NES game, with more than 17 million copies sold worldwide. It also inspired an animated television series, The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 
    3, produced by DIC Entertainment. </p>

                    <p>Beginning development shortly after the 1986 release of the Famicom Disk System's Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3 was developed by 
                    Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, a team that consisted of more than ten people. The game took more than two years to complete.
                    The development budget, when converted to US dollars, amounts to about $800,000 to $1.3 million ($2 3.2 million adjusted for inflation). 
                    Developer Shigeru Miyamoto served as director. He worked closely with the designers and programmers during the conceptual and final stages, 
                    encouraging a free interchange of ideas. Miyamoto considered intriguing and original ideas to be key to creating a successful game. Originally, 
                    the team intended for the game to be played from an isometric point of view, but the developers found that this made it too difficult to position 
                    jumps, so the game was changed to the 2D side view used in previous games.

        <p class="textMain">
            The game was designed to appeal to players of varying skill levels. To assist less-to no skill players, bonus coins and 1-ups are more abundant in earlier 
            worlds, while later worlds present more complex challenges for experienced players. In the two-player mode, the players alternate turns to balance play 
            time. The development team introduced new power-ups and concepts that would give Mario the appearance of different creatures as a means of providing him 
            with new abilities. An early idea changed Mario into a centaur, but was dropped in favor of a raccoon tail with limited flying ability. Other costumes 
            with different abilities were added to his repertoire, and levels were designed to take advantage of these abilities. New enemies were included to add 
            diversity to the game, along with variants of previous enemies, such as Goombas, Hammer Bros., and Koopa Troopas.
            <br><br>Some of the enemies designed for Super Mario Bros. 3 were inspired by the team's personal experiences. For example, the Chain Chomp enemy, a 
            barking tethered ball and chain creature with eyes and teeth that lunges at the player when in close proximity, was drawn from Miyamoto's early life, 
            in which a dog lunged at him, but was pulled away from him. Bowser's children, the Koopalings, were designed to be unique in appearance and 
            personality; Miyamoto based the characters on seven of his programmers as a tribute to their work and efforts.
            <br><br>The character graphics were created with a special graphics machine ("Character Generator Computer Aided Design") that generated a collection of 
            the graphical shapes used in the game. Shapes in the collection were assigned numbers that the game's code used to access and combine to form complete 
            images on the screen in real time. The Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge uses Nintendo's custom MMC3 ASIC to enhance the NES capabilities. The MMC3 chip 
            allows for animated tiles, extra RAM for diagonal scrolling, and a scan line timer to split the screen. The game uses these functions to split the game 
            screen into two portions, a playfield on the top and a status bar on the bottom. On the overworld map, the status bar doubles as an inventory for items 
            and power-ups. This allows the top portion to scroll as the character navigates the stage while the bottom portion remains static to display text and 
            other information.

            <p class="textMain">
                Super Mario Bros. 3 introduced several elements carried over to subsequent Mario games. A similar overworld map is used in Super Mario World, 
                Super Mario Bros. DX and New Super Mario Bros., and Mario's ability to fly has been a feature in games such as Super Mario World, Super Mario 64 and 
                Super Mario Galaxy. The game's "Super Leaf" item has returned in more recent Mario games for the Nintendo 3DS, like Super Mario 3D Land, Mario Kart 7 
                and New Super Mario Bros. 2. Bowser's red hair was first popularized in the game and has since become a part of his standard appearance.
            <br><br>
            In April 1993, Famicom TsÅ«shin (Famitsu) magazine awarded Super Mario Bros. 3 a world record for having the most strategy guide books published,
            with 20 strategy books published for the game up until then.
            <br>
            At the 2007 Game Developers Conference, Stanford University curator Henry Lowood, along with game designers Warren Spector and Steve Meretzky, academic 
            researcher Matteo Bittanti and game journalist Christopher Grant named Super Mario Bros. 3 one of the 10 most important video games of all time, 
            being a member of a "game canon" whose inductees were submitted to the Library of Congress for having "cultural significance or a historical significance".
            The New York Times reported Grant said its inclusion was due to the game's nonlinear play being a "mainstay of contemporary games", and how it allows the 
            player to move backward and forward in levels. On November 20, 2020, a sealed copy with rare alternate cover art featuring "Bros." on the left instead
             of the center was sold for $156,000, the most money ever paid for a video game at the time highest price ever for a single video game.
