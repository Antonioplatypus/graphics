    <p class = "textMain"> Donkey Kong was created to salvage unsold arcade cabinets following the failure of Nintendo's Radar Scope (1980). Hiroshi Yamauchi, 
    Nintendo's president at the time, assigned the project to first-time video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Drawing inspiration from Beauty and the Beast and 
    1930s American media such as Popeye and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside chief engineer Gunpei Yokoi. 
    They broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cutscenes to advance the plot, and integrating multiple stages into the 
    gameplay. 
    <br><br>The success of Donkey Kong positioned the company for market dominance from 1981 through the late 1990s. The game debuts Mario, who became Nintendo's 
    mascot and one of the world's most recognizable characters. Donkey Kong pioneered the platform game genre before the term existed; it is one of the most 
    important games from the golden age of arcade video games and one of the most popular arcade games of all time. </p>

                    <p>Nintendo of America was founded in 1980 with minor success at importing its parent's arcade cabinets from Japan. In early 1981, its president 
                        Minoru Arakawa bet the small startup company on a major order of 3,000 Radar Scope.Its poor reception in America filled a warehouse with 2,000 
                        unsold Radar Scope machines, so Arakawa requested that the parent company president Hiroshi Yamauchi send a conversion kit of new game software.
                        Yamauchi polled the company's entire talent pool for fresh game design concepts to save the distressed startup.This yielded Shigeru Miyamoto's 
                        debut as lead game designer of his Donkey Kong concept, and Yamauchi appointed head engineer Gunpei Yokoi as project supervisor with a budget of 
                        $267,000 (equivalent to $859,000 in 2022) according to Miyamoto.

            Miyamoto had high hopes for his new project. He was not a programmer, so instead consulted technicians for concept feasibility. He wanted to make the 
            characters different sizes, and have different movements and reactions. Yokoi thought Miyamoto's original design was too complex, though he had some 
            difficult suggestions, such as using see-saws to catapult the hero across the screen which was eventually found too hard to program, 
            though a similar concept came later in the Popeye arcade game. Miyamoto then thought of using sloped platforms, barrels, and ladders. 
            When he specified that the game would have multiple stages, the four-man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to implement 
            the game repeatedly. Nevertheless, they followed Miyamoto's design, creating a total of approximately 20 kilobytes of content. Yukio Kaneoka composed a 
            soundtrack to serve as background music for the levels and story events.

            The circuit board of Radar Scope was restructured for Donkey Kong.The gameplay and graphics were reworked for updated ROM chips, and the existing CPU, sound hardware,
            and monitor were left intact.The Donkey Kong hardware has the memory capacity for displaying 128 foreground sprites at 16x16 pixels each and 256 
            background tiles at 8x8 pixels each. Mario and all moving objects use single sprites, the taller Pauline uses two sprites, and the larger 
            Donkey Kong uses six sprites.

            <p class="textMain">
                In 1996 Next Generation listed the arcade, Atari 7800, and cancelled Coleco Adam versions as number 50 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time", 
                commenting that even ignoring its massive historical significance, Donkey Kong stands as a great game due to its demanding challenges and graphics 
                which manage to elegantly delineate an entire scenario on a single screen. In February 2006, Nintendo Power rated it the 148th best game made 
                on a Nintendo system. In 2017, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted Donkey Kong to its World Video Game Hall of Fame. Today, Donkey Kong is the
                fifth most popular arcade game among collectors.

            Donkey Kong spawned a number of other titles with a mix of running, jumping and vertical traversal, a novel genre that did not match the style of games 
            that came before it. The genre was initially referred to as "Donkey Kong-type" or "Kong-style" games, before the genre eventually came to be known as 
            platform games. The game was also a milestone in terms of video game storytelling and cutscenes. While there were earlier games that either told a 
            story or used cutscenes, Donkey Kong combined both concepts together to introduce its own new concept: using cutscenes to visually advance a complete 
            story. It also notably had multiple, distinct levels that progressed the storyline
