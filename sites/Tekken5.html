        The game reverts several major gameplay changes introduced in Tekken 4, such as uneven stage terrain, in favor of a more fluid gameplay akin to the older games in the series. It is also the first game in the series to feature the ability to customize characters with accessories, clothing, and other aesthetic items purchased with in-game currency. There are up to 32 fighters to choose from, including seven new fighters, as well as Jin's alter-ego Devil Jin.

        The game was upgraded to Tekken 5.1, which had mostly balance changes to the gameplay, and later received the update Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection which was released in 2005 and later ported to the PlayStation Portable and the PlayStation 3 as Tekken: Dark Resurrection. Tekken 5 was a critical and commercial success, selling over 8.2 million copies including expansion. Critics praised the return of classic gameplay features and the large amount of replay value provided by the PlayStation 2 port though the final boss was criticized for being too powerful, while Jin's story mode was perceived as "boring" in comparison to the fighting game part. The sequel entitled Tekken 6 was released in 2007.         </p>

            After the release of Tekken 4, series director Katsuhiro Harada left Namco due to pressure with game's poor sales. Harada's boss insisted him to keep producing more titles as he was capable of pleasing people with his work. After a year away, Harada went back to the company explaining it was due to his passion with fighting games. Namco first announced Tekken 5 in E3 2004 during May. Harada aimed to make it the best game in the entire franchise to celebrate its 10th anniversary. He aimed to amplify the action elements of the games and make them more over-the-top. In regards to the handling of the game following the negative backlash of Tekken 4, Harada claims Namco used this response to develop the game. Namco also aimed to make the game fitting for newcomers. The early success of the arcade led the team to research for more content to add in future installments. Based on the company's revolutionary Dynamic Motion Synthesis technology, endorphin was chosen to implement an AI and dynamics simulation to create 3D character animation in real-time, thus dramatically accelerating 3D animation pipelines in games and visual effect studios. Shinichiro Yoda of Namco was optimisitic with this decision. Torsten Reil, CEO of NaturalMotion, said that they were delighted by Namco as they had already put it in test for its first trailer. The arcade cabinet of the game was notable for allowing players to use their PlayStation 2 controls over the regular arcade system. The team felt that for the first time in years, the franchise made a notable progress thanks to Tekken 5.
             <br><br>
             Harada wanted the game to be enjoyable to newcomers as a result of multiple playable characters that might be difficult to master. A blur effect was added to the visuals while several stages were given flames. Early in the production, Tekken 5 was meant to have 20 playable characters, with the selected returning ones being the most popular ones. New movements were added to the returning cast. 600 items were also made for the idea of customization. Among the newcomers, Asuka Kazama stands as a replacement from the missing Jun Kazama who only appeared in Tekken 2 and Tag Tournament. Despite promotion from Tekken 5 claiming that the character has died in the intro, Namco Bandai denied this statement in interviews. Tekken 5 also makes most characters use their own native language during cutscenes, introductions to battles and victory scenes. Producer Takai Homma was in charge of this part of the game. Homma recalls having fun in giving the characters their respective lines as well subtitles. This also led to animal characters having their own lines which have to be read. The goal of Homma was surpassing the two previous Tekken games.            </p>

                The game features a large cast of music composers, including Akitaka Tohyama, Yoshihito Yano, Yuu Miyake, Junichi Nakatsuru, Satoru K≈çsaki, Rio Hamamoto, Ryuichi Takada, and Hiroshi Okubo. The same team also worked on the PS2 version, with the addition of Tetsukazu Nakanishi, Keiichi Okabe, Kohta Takahashi, Kazuhiro Nakamura, Keiki Kobayashi, Nobuyoshi Sano, and Katsuro Tajima. The opening song for the PS2 version, "Sparking", features vocals by Tom Leonard and Jeff Pescetto. The music encompasses many genres, including techno, rock and nu metal. Victor Entertainment released the soundtrack.

                Tekken 5 was also awarded "Best Fighting Game of 2005" by GameSpot, and "Best PlayStation 2 Fighting Game" by IGN. During the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, Tekken 5 received a nomination for "Fighting Game of the Year", which was ultimately awarded to fellow Namco fighting game Soulcalibur III.
                                                    <br><br>
            Tekken 5 was ranked by Complex as the sixth best PlayStation 2 game. SNK staff member Falcoon said Tekken 5 was one of his favorite games in 2005 although he did not consider himself an expert in the game. Game designer Tomonobu Itagaki heavily panned the console port of the game for lacking innovative features after several installments from the franchise. Similarly, The Rough Guide to Videogames felt the story was convoluted and that the Devil Within was poorly done. PC Mag listed Paul Phoenix's and Lee Chaolan's endings as two of the "craziest" moments in the franchise.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    The game's critical praise was matched with commercial success. As of July 2009, it has sold around 6 million copies. In retrospective, Harada believes Tekken 5, and Tekken 6, managed to attract a new group of fans, something Tekken 4 failed to do. A sequel, Tekken 6, was released in 2007. The first CGI scene from the game also influenced the developers to create a film titled Tekken: Blood Vengeance (2011) which uses this type of animation.
